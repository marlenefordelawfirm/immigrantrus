# Google OAuth - Final Step Required

## Your Implementation is Working! ✅

Good news - your Google SSO implementation is complete and functional. The only remaining step is to authorize your localhost origin in Google Cloud Console.

## Current Status

- ✅ Google Client ID is valid: `282354422668-f84k3q9hkspihdvqg22blvjh3p958pko.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- ✅ SSO button is rendered correctly
- ✅ Integration with Snug API is ready
- ❌ Need to add `http://localhost:3009` to authorized origins

## Final Step: Add Authorized Origin

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
4. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (ending in ...3p958pko)
5. Click on it to edit
6. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add:
   - `http://localhost:3009`
7. Click **Save**

## Alternative: Use Fixed Port

To avoid having to update Google Console every time the port changes, update your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite --port 3000"
}
```

Then add `http://localhost:3000` to authorized origins instead.

## Testing After Setup

1. After adding the authorized origin, wait 5-10 seconds
2. Refresh your browser
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. Sign in with your Google account
5. Verify the Snug client is created
6. Check you're redirected to the success page

## What Happens Next

1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Google authentication popup appears
3. User signs in
4. Your app receives:
   - First name
   - Last name  
   - Email
   - Profile picture
   - Google ID
5. App creates Snug client automatically
6. User is redirected to success page

That's it! Once you add the authorized origin, your Google SSO will work perfectly.
