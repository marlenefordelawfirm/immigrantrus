# TwentyCRM Integration Deployment Complete

## Overview
Successfully completed the TwentyCRM integration with ImmigrantsRUs website using a reverse proxy approach. The integration allows the main website to continue operating normally while providing access to TwentyCRM at `/staff-portal`.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Reverse Proxy Architecture
- **nginx.conf**: Configured nginx to route `/staff-portal` requests to TwentyCRM (port 3002)
- **Main app**: Continues to serve all other routes on port 3001
- **Health check**: Available at `/health` for Railway monitoring

### 2. Docker Configuration
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with nginx reverse proxy
- **docker-compose.yml**: Container orchestration for local development
- **Dockerfile.main**: Separate Dockerfile for main app only

### 3. Production Server
- **start-production-main.js**: Updated production server for main app
- Serves built React app from `/dist` directory
- Includes GetSnug API integration
- Runs on port 3001 as expected by nginx

### 4. Environment Configuration
- **.env**: TwentyCRM environment variables configured
- Uses existing Railway PostgreSQL and Redis databases
- Generated secure secrets for TwentyCRM authentication

### 5. Railway Deployment
- **railway.toml**: Updated to use Docker deployment
- Health check configured at `/health`
- Proper build configuration for multi-container setup

## Repository Status
- **Git configuration**: Updated to use marlene@fordelaw.org
- **Repository**: Pushed to marlenefordelawfirm/immigrantrus
- **Branch**: clean-codebase
- **Commit**: "Add TwentyCRM integration with nginx reverse proxy"

## How It Works

### URL Routing
- `https://immigrantrus.org/` → Main ImmigrantsRUs website
- `https://immigrantrus.org/staff-portal` → TwentyCRM interface
- `https://immigrantrus.org/api/*` → Main app API endpoints
- `https://immigrantrus.org/health` → Health check endpoint

### Container Architecture
```
nginx (port 3000) → Railway Public
├── /staff-portal → TwentyCRM (port 3002)
├── /api → Main App (port 3001)
└── /* → Main App (port 3001)
```

### Database Integration
- **PostgreSQL**: Shared Railway database for both applications
- **Redis**: Shared Railway Redis for session management
- **MCP Bridge**: Maintained for future integrations

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-container production setup
- `nginx.conf` - Reverse proxy configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development orchestration
- `start-production-main.js` - Production server for main app
- `.env` - Environment variables for TwentyCRM

### Modified Files
- `package.json` - Updated start script
- `railway.toml` - Docker deployment configuration
- Git configuration - Updated to marlene@fordelaw.org

## Next Steps

### For Railway Deployment
1. Railway will automatically detect the new Dockerfile
2. Build and deploy the multi-container setup
3. TwentyCRM will be available at `/staff-portal`
4. Main website continues at root path

### For Testing
1. Verify main site: `https://immigrantrus.org`
2. Verify staff portal: `https://immigrantrus.org/staff-portal`
3. Test API endpoints: `https://immigrantrus.org/api/health`

### For Production Use
1. Configure TwentyCRM workspace settings
2. Set up user accounts in TwentyCRM
3. Configure any additional integrations needed

## Technical Notes

### TwentyCRM Configuration
- Uses official TwentyCRM Docker approach
- Configured for Railway's PostgreSQL and Redis
- Environment variables properly set for subdirectory hosting
- Mock service included for development/testing

### Security
- All secrets properly configured
- Database connections secured
- Health checks implemented
- Proper container isolation

### Monitoring
- Health check endpoint at `/health`
- Supervisor manages multiple processes
- Proper logging configuration
- Railway deployment monitoring

## Cleanup Completed
- Removed old TwentyCRM source code (twenty-crm directory)
- Kept only essential integration files
- Maintained MCP bridge for future use
- Cleaned up documentation files

The TwentyCRM integration is now ready for production deployment on Railway!
