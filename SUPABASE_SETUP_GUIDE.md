# Supabase Setup Guide for ImmigrantsRUs CRM

## What We Need to Complete

To get the ImmigrantsRUs CRM fully operational, we need to:
1. Create a Supabase project
2. Set up the database schema
3. Get the connection credentials
4. Configure environment variables
5. Test the CRM API

## Step 1: Create Supabase Project

### What You Need to Do:

1. **Go to Supabase**: Visit https://supabase.com
2. **Sign in/Sign up**: Create account or log in
3. **Create New Project**:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Choose your organization (or create one)
   - Project Name: `immigrantrus-crm` (or similar)
   - Database Password: Create a strong password (save this!)
   - Region: Choose closest to your users (probably US East or US West)
   - Pricing Plan: Free tier is fine for development/testing

### What I Need From You:

Once your project is created, please provide me with:

1. **Project URL**: Found in Project Settings ‚Üí API
   - Format: `https://[project-ref].supabase.co`
   
2. **Anon Public Key**: Found in Project Settings ‚Üí API
   - Labeled as "anon public" 
   - Starts with "eyJ..."

3. **Database Password**: The password you set when creating the project

## Step 2: Set Up Database Schema

Once you provide the credentials, I will:
1. Use the SQL from `database/schema.sql` to create the tables
2. Set up proper indexes and security policies
3. Add sample data for testing

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

I'll help you set up:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Step 4: Test the CRM

After setup, we'll test all the API endpoints to ensure everything works.

## Current Status

‚úÖ CRM API code is complete (`api/immigrantrus-crm.js`)
‚úÖ Database schema is ready (`database/schema.sql`)  
‚úÖ Vercel configuration is updated
‚è≥ **WAITING**: Supabase project credentials from you

## What to Send Me

Please reply with:
1. Your Supabase project URL
2. Your anon public key
3. Confirmation that the project was created successfully

Then I can immediately proceed with setting up the database and testing the CRM!

## Optional: GetSnug Integration

If you want to integrate with GetSnug CRM later, you'll also need:
- GetSnug API key
- GetSnug API endpoint URL

But this is optional and can be added later.

## Timeline

Once you provide the Supabase credentials:
- Database setup: 5 minutes
- Environment configuration: 2 minutes  
- API testing: 5 minutes
- **Total**: ~15 minutes to have a fully functional CRM

Ready when you are! üöÄ
