# Final Google OAuth Solution

## Current Status: Still Getting "Client ID Not Found" Error

Even after updating to a test client ID, you're still seeing "[GSI_LOGGER]: The given client ID is not found." This confirms that **any Google OAuth client must be specifically configured for your exact domain/port**.

## The Root Problem

Google OAuth clients are **extremely strict** about authorized origins. The client must be configured in Google Cloud Console with:
- Exact protocol: `http://` (for development)
- Exact domain: `localhost` 
- Exact port: `3009` (your current port)

Since your server is now running on `http://localhost:3009`, any OAuth client must have this **exact** URL in its authorized JavaScript origins.

## Solution 1: Create Your Own Google OAuth Client (Recommended)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Create a New Project** (or select existing):
   - Project name: "Immigrants R Us"
   - Project ID: `immigrants-r-us-[random]`
3. **Enable Google Identity API**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Search "Google Identity Services API"
   - Click "Enable"
4. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "OAuth consent screen"
   - Choose "External" user type
   - Fill required fields:
     - App name: "Immigrants R Us"
     - User support email: your email
     - Developer contact: your email
   - Save and continue through all steps
5. **Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
   - Application type: "Web application"
   - Name: "Immigrants R Us - Dev Client"
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**:
     - `http://localhost:3009` ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Must match your current port**
     - `http://localhost:3000` (backup for future)
     - `http://localhost:3008` (backup for future)
   - **Authorized redirect URIs** (optional):
     - `http://localhost:3009/oauth-callback`
6. **Copy the Client ID**:
   - It will look like: `123456789-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com`
   - Replace in your `.env.local` file

### Update .env.local:
```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_ID_FROM_STEP_6
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_ID_FROM_STEP_6
```

## Solution 2: Mock Google OAuth (Immediate Testing)

If you want to test the flow immediately without setting up Google OAuth, I can create a mock implementation that simulates the Google OAuth flow for development.

## Solution 3: Force Specific Port

To avoid port conflicts, we can configure Vite to always use port 3008:

1. Update `package.json` scripts:
```json
"dev": "vite --port 3008"
```

2. This ensures consistent port for OAuth configuration.

## Expected Result After Proper Setup

✅ **No more "Client ID not found" errors**  
✅ **Successful Google OAuth popup**  
✅ **Authentication completes successfully**  
✅ **User redirected to success page**

## Which Solution Do You Prefer?

1. **Set up your own Google OAuth client** (most reliable, production-ready)
2. **Create a mock implementation** (immediate testing, development only)
3. **Fix the port configuration** (ensures consistent OAuth setup)
