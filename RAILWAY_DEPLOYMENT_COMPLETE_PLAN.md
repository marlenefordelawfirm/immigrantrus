# Railway Deployment - Complete Implementation Plan

## Current Situation (CORRECTED)

✅ **Railway Service**: `immigrantrus` (main service deployed via GitHub)
✅ **PostgreSQL Database**: Running and connected to main service
✅ **Redis Database**: Running and connected to main service
✅ **Main Website**: Working at immigrantrus.org
❌ **Staff Portal Issue**: Shows "Unable to Reach Back-end" - CRM backend not running
❌ **Unnecessary Service**: `immigrantrus-crm` was deleted (correct decision)

## The Real Problem

The main `immigrantrus` Railway service is only running the website frontend, but NOT the TwentyCRM backend server that the staff portal needs to connect to.

## The Solution

**Integrate TwentyCRM backend into the existing Railway service** so it runs:
1. Main website (current)
2. TwentyCRM backend server (new)

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Configure TwentyCRM for Railway Production

1. **Set up TwentyCRM environment variables** in Railway service
   - Connect to existing PostgreSQL database (separate schema)
   - Connect to existing Redis database
   - Configure authentication bypass for production

2. **Update Railway deployment configuration**
   - Modify start command to run both website AND TwentyCRM backend
   - Configure proper port routing
   - Ensure TwentyCRM backend starts alongside website

### Phase 2: Database Integration

1. **Create separate TwentyCRM database schema** in existing PostgreSQL
2. **Configure TwentyCRM to use Railway databases**
3. **Run database migrations** for TwentyCRM tables
4. **Test database connectivity**

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration

1. **Update StaffPortalPage** to redirect to correct TwentyCRM backend
2. **Ensure `/staff-portal` serves TwentyCRM frontend**
3. **Configure API routing** for seamless integration

### Phase 4: Deploy & Test

1. **Deploy integrated solution** to Railway
2. **Test complete flow**: immigrantrus.org/staff-portal → Working TwentyCRM
3. **Verify authentication bypass** works in production
4. **Confirm database connections** and data flow

## Expected Result

- **immigrantrus.org** → Main website (unchanged)
- **immigrantrus.org/staff-portal** → Working TwentyCRM with authentication bypass
- **TwentyCRM backend** running on Railway alongside main website
- **Separate database schema** for CRM data
- **Uses existing PostgreSQL and Redis** databases

## Files to Modify

1. **Railway configuration** (package.json start script or railway.toml)
2. **TwentyCRM environment variables** (.env files)
3. **Database configuration** for TwentyCRM
4. **StaffPortalPage.tsx** (if needed for routing)

## Success Criteria

✅ Click "Staff Portal" on homepage
✅ Goes to `/staff-portal` 
✅ Loads working TwentyCRM (no authentication barriers)
✅ TwentyCRM connects to Railway databases
✅ No "Unable to Reach Back-end" errors
✅ Everything runs on single Railway service

---

**Next Action**: Configure TwentyCRM environment variables and update Railway deployment to run both services.
