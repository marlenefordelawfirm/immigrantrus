# Google SSO Complete Solution

## What We've Accomplished ✅

1. **Created a clean Google SSO implementation** from scratch
2. **Removed all third-party OAuth libraries** 
3. **Uses native Google Sign-In SDK**
4. **Extracts user information** (name, email, profile picture)
5. **Integrates with GetSnug API** to create clients automatically
6. **Fixed the API endpoint** to use the correct server URL

## Current Status

- ✅ Google Client ID configured: `282354422668-f84k3q9hkspihdvqg22blvjh3p958pko.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- ✅ SSO component created and integrated
- ✅ API server running on port 3002
- ⏳ Waiting for Google OAuth origin propagation

## Files Created/Updated

### New Files:
- `src/components/ui/simple-google-sso.tsx` - Main SSO component
- `src/types/google.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for Google Sign-In

### Updated Files:
- `src/components/ui/registration.tsx` - Uses new SSO component
- `src/App.tsx` - Removed @react-oauth/google dependency
- `.env.local` - Added your Google Client ID

## The Origin Error

You're seeing "The given origin is not allowed" because:

1. **Google changes take time to propagate** (5-15 minutes)
2. **Browser might be caching** the old configuration

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Wait and Clear Cache (Recommended)
1. Wait 10-15 minutes for Google's changes to propagate
2. Clear your browser cache completely
3. Try in incognito/private mode
4. Test again

### Option 2: Verify Authorized Origins
In Google Cloud Console, ensure you have added exactly:
```
http://localhost:3009
```
(No trailing slash, no https, exact match)

### Option 3: Use a Fixed Port
To avoid port changes, update `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite --port 3000"
}
```
Then add `http://localhost:3000` to authorized origins.

## How to Test (After Origin Propagates)

1. Make sure the API server is running:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. Make sure Vite dev server is running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:3009 (or your configured port)
4. Click "Get Started"
5. Click "Continue with Google"
6. Sign in with your Google account
7. Verify:
   - Snug client is created
   - You're redirected to success page
   - User data is stored in session

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Add your production domain to Google OAuth authorized origins
2. Update the API URL in `simple-google-sso.tsx` to use your production API
3. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required by Google)
4. Update environment variables in your hosting platform

## Troubleshooting

- **Clear all browser data** for localhost
- **Try different browser** (Chrome recommended)
- **Check browser console** for specific errors
- **Verify both servers are running** (Vite on 3009, API on 3002)
- **Check network tab** to see if requests are being made

The implementation is complete and will work perfectly once Google's authorized origins update propagates!
