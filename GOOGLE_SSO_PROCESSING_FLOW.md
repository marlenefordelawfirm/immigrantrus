# Google SSO with Processing Page Flow

## New Improved Flow ✨

We've separated the authentication and client creation into distinct steps for better user experience:

### 1. **Authentication** (Google SSO)
- User clicks "Continue with Google"
- Google handles authentication
- User data is extracted from JWT token
- Data is stored in sessionStorage
- User is redirected to `/processing`

### 2. **Processing Page** (New!)
- Shows a loading spinner with status updates
- Creates the GetSnug client in the background
- Handles errors gracefully
- Always navigates to success page (even if Snug fails)

### 3. **Success Page**
- Shows success message
- Displays debug information if needed
- Shows appropriate status based on Snug client creation

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Better User Experience**
   - No blocking alerts
   - Clear visual feedback during processing
   - Smooth transitions between pages

2. **Error Handling**
   - If Google auth succeeds but Snug fails, user still sees success
   - Errors are logged but don't block the flow
   - Debug information available on success page

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Authentication is separate from client creation
   - Each page has a single responsibility
   - Easier to debug and maintain

## File Structure

```
src/
├── components/ui/
│   └── simple-google-sso.tsx    # Google SSO button
├── pages/
│   ├── ProcessingPage.tsx       # NEW: Loading/processing page
│   └── SuccessPage.tsx          # Final success page
└── App.tsx                      # Updated with new route
```

## Testing the Flow

1. Click "Continue with Google"
2. Select your Google account
3. You'll see the processing page with a spinner
4. After a few seconds, you'll be redirected to success page
5. Click "Show Debug Logs" to see what happened

## Troubleshooting

If you see "An error occurred during sign-in":
- This is likely the Google OAuth origin not being propagated yet
- Wait 10-15 minutes and try again
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try in incognito mode

The new flow ensures that even if there are issues, the user experience remains smooth!
